    A BIT (Binary Indexed Tree) or Fenwick Tree is a data structure providing efficient methods for calculation and manipulation of the prefix sums of a table of values.


    It supports the following operations :

    SUM(1在): Cumulative sum of elements in the range [1在]
    SUM(a在): Cumulative sum of elements in the range [a在]
    UPDATE(k, v): Update kth element by an amount v ( v can be +ve or -ve)
    SCALE_UP(c): Multiply all elements by an amount c
    SCALE_DOWN(c): Divide all elements by an amount c
    Space Complexity: O(N) for N elements

    Time Complexity: O(log N) for SUM and UPDATE and O(N) for SCALE, where N is the number of elements
